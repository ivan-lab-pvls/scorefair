Kane scored four minutes later when he poked the ball in from close range after a scramble in front of goal.",

A Champions League trophy delivered without a recognised, world-class No 9 in the team.\nKylian Mbappe will arrive at Real Madrid having snubbed the Spanish giants three times. Once after a trial with Real's U12 team, then twice to favour PSG in 2017 and 2022. Now he will arrive at the Bernabeu when his new side need him most.\nReal will now have their world-class No 9 - arguably one of the best out there. The problem is, what happens to players like Vinicius and Bellingham following their heroics not just at Wembley, but all through the season?",

It was Luton who took the spoils from mayhem that was largely Sheffield United’s doing.\n\nWhere Luton’s spirit and determination has been apparent from the opening kicks of the season, it has taken until the second coming of Chris Wilder for the Blades to exhibit similar qualities. In his fifth game since replacing Paul Heckingbottom he ripped up his own gameplan and his team snatched a deserved lead only for composure to desert them.

Not only were Chelsea spending \$1bn of transfer money in record-breaking fashion while attempting to rewrite accounting principles, but Citizen Todd was only too happy to tell the world of his exciting plans for the Premier League.\n\nHe hasn’t disappeared completely. Baseball-capped, dressed for the cold, he attended Chelsea’s match with Brighton in early December, but it has been some time since the football public heard from him. Club politics, wider football politics and perhaps most of all, Chelsea’s rather embarrassing slide, have each served to reduce the need for the Marylander to hold forth in the manner that quickly made his name.",
